## Resistor
![Resistor](../files/parts/resistor.png)

In electronic circuits, resistors are used to reduce current flow, adjust signal levels, to divide voltages, bias active elements, and terminate transmission lines, among other uses.


## LED
![LED](../files/parts/led.png)

Light Emiting Diode is a component that emits light.

## Push Button switches

![Push Button switches](../files/parts/pushbutton.png)

Push button switches come in 2 varieties, momentary and push-on/push-off

## Slide/Toggle On/Off switches

![Push Button switches](../files/parts/slide.png)

Slide/Toggle switches are components that when activated are either on or off. Their levers have to physically moved to engage whether the position.

## Potentiometer

![Potentiometer](../files/parts/potentiometer.png)

Potentiometer is a sensor whose resistance changes based on rotating its knob/shaft.

## Photoresistor

![Photoresistor](../files/parts/photoresistor.png)

Photoresistor is a light sensor whose resistance changes based on light.

## Temperature Sensor

![Temperature Sensor](../files/parts/tempsensor.png)

Temperature Sensor is sensor the returns the current temperature.

## Gas Sensor

![Gas Sensor](../files/parts/gassensor.png)

Gas Sensor is sensor the returns the amount of a particular gas is in the current atmosphere. These sensors range from CO2, Methane, to other gases.

## Tilt Switch

![Tilt Switch](../files/parts/tiltswitch.png)

Tilt Switch is a switch that only engages when you tilt the component. Unlike a Accelerometer/Gyroscope it is binary meaning it is on or off.


## Accelerometer/Gyroscope
![Accelerometer](https://www.iotone.com/files/term/accelerometer_6.jpg)

This sensor is used for the detection of movement and tilt and returns the range of movement and tilt.


## DC Motor
![DC Motor](../files/parts/dcmotor.png)

A motor generally used for continuous motion. Like an RC car.

## Vibration Motor
![Vibration Motor](../files/parts/vibrationmotor.png)

A motor generally used for haptic feedback. Like in a cellphone.

## Servo Motor
![Servo Motor](../files/parts/servomotor.png)

Servo Motor is a motor generally use for positioning

## Piezo Speaker
![Piezo Speaker](../files/parts/piezo.png)

Piezo Speaker are usually use for lo fidelity sound, like door bell.

## Proximity Sensor
![Proximity Sensor](../files/parts/proximitysensor.png)

Usually come in 2 types, Ultrasonic and IR. Ultrasonic sensors use waves to determine the distance of an object. IR Sensors can be used to tell the distance, but also operate as a digital sensor, telling the user whether a person or object is in the space.
