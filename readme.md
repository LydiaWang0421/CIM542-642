# Class Schedule

### Week 1: Class Introduction

* Class intro
* Intro to Arduino
* Ideation Workshop: Crazy Machine - Create a fantasy machine that a user can interact with.

#### HW 1
* Create an interface for your machine using the [Storyboard Worksheet](files\StoryboardWorksheet.pdf)
  * Use the parts worksheet to prototype your machine. You can choose to prototype a particular aspect of your machine.
* [Student Survey](https://goo.gl/forms/1YEsS1fAeXefNjHO2)
* Buy Arduino Kit
  * [Arduino.cc](https://store.arduino.cc/usa/arduino-starter-kit)
  * [Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/Arduino-Starter-Kit-English-Official/dp/B009UKZV0A/ref=sr_1_4?ie=UTF8&qid=1516635157&sr=8-4&keywords=arduino+starter+kit)


#### Week 2: Intro to Physical Computing, Basic Electricity and Electronics

* [Intro to Electricity and Components Slides](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1OZsjOAGmvX9IuKPb8RYilajWWwStS34MV0bU8o1sHWA/edit?usp=sharing)
* Intro to Arduino Kit
* [Intro to Arduino IDE](/Notes/Intro-to-Arduino.md)

* [Variables](/Notes/Variables.md)
* [Debugging](/Notes/Debugging.md)
* Introduction to logic flow

##### HW 3:

  * User Flow
    * How can you create an interface with one button interface and an led? Take a minute and observe your surroundings. Find piece of electronics that you can augment/add a feature with a button and an led. Think about modes and outputs to express an action and reaction. Create a flow using Googleâ€™s drawing app to explain how a user interacts with your interface.
      * Microwave
      * Coffeemaker
      * TV

##### HW 5:
* Knock Lock
* Sensor Walk - Go to a public area, A park, Food Court, Mall, Etc
  * Find 6 points of interaction between people and electronics, mechanical devices, signage, or any other areas of high traffic
  * What are the inputs?
    * Find switches, levers, buttons, visual aids
    * Are the inputs active(electronic or mechanical) or passive
      * If Active
        * What is the sensor?
        * What triggers the sensor?
      * If Passive
        * What is the User doing?
        * Are they walking up?
   * What are the outputs?
     * Lights, sound, motors, signage
     * Is the output active or passive
       * If Active,
         * What does it do when triggered?
       * If Passive
         * What is it?
           * Map
           * Sign
* Research Parts
  * Based on 3 inputs/outputs from the Sensor Walk, research potential sensors used in the input or output
  * Search in [amazon](https://www.amazon.com/), [adafruit](https://www.adafruit.com/), and [sparkfun](https://www.sparkfun.com/), [robotshop](https://www.robotshop.com/) for potential matches
